  This directory contains a simple test script which is designed
 to test the HTTP-Hosts running upon my personal machine.

  Although they are not useful to others in any real sense they
 may provide an example of testing availability and functionality
 which would be useful.

  The test script is designed to test two specific things:

    * Test that HTTP fetches of particular hosts receive contain
      some expected & static text.

    * Test that requests to particular pages will generate a
      HTTP-Redirection response to a particular virtual host.
