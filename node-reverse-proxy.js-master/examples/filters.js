/**
 *  This is an example configuration for a reverse proxy which listens
 * upon:
 *
 *     127.0.0.1:8080
 *
 *  It forwards all traffic to 127.0.0.1:80, due to a simple regular
 * expression which matches all incoming Host: headers - and thus
 * all possible virtual hosts.
 *
 *  The interesting thing about this example is that it uses two
 * filters to modify both:
 *
 *   1.  The request sent to the back-end server.
 *
 *   2.  The response from the back-end server.
 *
 *  In both cases "node-reverse-proxy.js" is appended to a header,
 * and additional some URL munging is applied globally to incoming
 * requests.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *  -----
 *
 *  To use this configuration file please run:
 *
 *   ./node-reverse-proxy.js --config ./examples/filters.js
 *
