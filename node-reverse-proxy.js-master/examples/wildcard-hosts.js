 *
 * Will :
 *
 *   a.  Succeed.
 *
 *   b.  Present the hgwebdir interface to the specific project named in the hostname.
 *
 * This is a pretty basic operation, but it requires that we modify
 * the incoming "Host:" header which was submitted by the client,
 * and also allow some files to be passed through unmolested:
 *
 *    /favicon.ico
 *    /robots.txt
 *
 * The configuration presented here does precisely that.
